Here you will find the scripts needed to process the raw fastq files from our 3 deep mutational scanning experiments:

* Human _FAS_ exon 6 (data from [Julien et al., 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms11558) and accessible at [ENA PRJEB13140](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB13140)).
* Ancestral _FAS_ exon 6 (new data, accessible at GEO XXXXX).
* _PSMD14_ exon 11 (new data, accessible at GEO XXXX).

To process these files from scratch you need to have [DiMSum](https://github.com/lehner-lab/DiMSum) installed in your system (this is the pipeline developed in our lab to process deep mutational scanning data).
