# Rescale Alternative Exon Datasets

Here I explain the code in [001\_rescale\_alternative\_exon\_datasets.R](./001_rescale_alternative_exon_datasets.R), where I rescale the PSI distributions of previously-published alternative exon datasets. This document relates to figures 1 and S1 in the manuscript.

Unless stated otherwise, all of the code in this document is written in R.
